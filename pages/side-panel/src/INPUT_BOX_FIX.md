# Fixed: Input Box Not Rendering Issue

## Problem Identified
The Ask AI input box was not rendering in the original side panel because the `ComposerFooter` component was only being rendered when an `article` existed.

## Root Cause
```tsx
{/* BEFORE: Only rendered when article exists */}
{article && (
  <div ref={footerRef}>
    <ComposerFooter ... />
  </div>
)}
```

This caused the following issues:
1. **No Article = No Footer**: When users first open the side panel before any article is loaded, the entire footer (including Ask AI input) would be hidden
2. **No AI Access**: Users couldn't ask AI questions about the current page content if no article was found
3. **Inconsistent UX**: The interface would appear broken or incomplete

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Removed Conditional Rendering**
```tsx
{/* AFTER: Always rendered for consistent UX */}
<div ref={footerRef} className="relative">
  <AskAIDrawer ... />
  <ComposerFooter ... />
</div>
```

### 2. **Benefits of This Change**
✅ **Always Available**: Ask AI input is now always accessible
✅ **Consistent Interface**: Footer appears regardless of article state  
✅ **Better UX**: Users can immediately interact with AI about any content
✅ **Progressive Enhancement**: Works with or without loaded articles

### 3. **Context Handling**
The AI drawer still intelligently adapts its context:
- **With Article**: Uses article title and content
- **With Page Data**: Uses extracted page information  
- **Fallback**: Uses document title or "Current Page"

```tsx
contextTitle={article?.title || pageData?.title || document.title || 'Current Page'}
```

## Technical Details

### Before Fix:
```
Page Load → No Article → No Footer → No Ask AI Input ❌
```

### After Fix:
```
Page Load → Footer Always Present → Ask AI Always Available ✅
```

### Maintained Functionality:
- Comments dock still only shows when relevant (with articles or loading highlights)
- All existing state management preserved
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## User Impact

### Previously:
- Users would see incomplete interface
- Ask AI unavailable until article loaded
- Confusing experience for new users

### Now:
- Complete interface always visible
- Ask AI immediately accessible
- Consistent, professional appearance
- Better onboarding experience

This fix ensures the Ask AI functionality is always available, providing a much better user experience and making the side panel feel complete and functional from the moment it loads.
